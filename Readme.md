[PVZ1.0.1] Update Logs
**Emergency update for waves not refreshing and incorrect number of zombies generated
Most of the game elements have been created
Problems still exist:
Pole vaulting zombies are unfinished and appear with undetermined behavior.
Shovel is unfinished, you can't reverse it after you click it for the first time, it will definitely shovel the plants on the lawn you clicked for the second time. **Note: Do not click on the plant slot after clicking on the shovel for the first time, as I have no idea what will happen, and while nothing should happen, it's a pain in the ass to build this project and then go back and carefully read your own miniature shit mountain.
Subsequent updates on goals:
--Cheat function
--Finish shoveling
--Finish pole vaulting zombies
--Add items similar to energy beans/chlorophyll in PVZ2
--More plants/zombies

[PVZ1.1.0] Changelog
Added three different reinforcement mechanisms
--Sunflower, when clicked, it will be judged at the next sunlight generation, and if the current number of sunlight on the field is greater than or equal to 200, 200 sunlight will be deducted to make it permanently evolve into a Twin Sunflower (as to why the price is more expensive than the Twin Sunflower in the original PVZ it is because you can interpret it as a Twin Sunflower with 0CD).
--Pea Shooter/Double Shot Pea Shooter, when clicked, if the current sunlight count on the field is greater than or equal to 200, 200 sunlight is deducted, causing it to spawn a cloud of peas (30) on its next attack determination.
--Nut Wall, if the current number of sunlight on the field is greater than or equal to 200, deduct 200 sunlight, make its HP increase by 2000 points; as for the posting issue, the author just thought of it while writing this changelog, and if he has time afterward, he will improve it.
--As for why it's not energy beans/chlorophyll/authentic twin sunflowers, the decals are too hard to find.
--Shovels and pole-vaulting zombies aren't finished yet, too few people play them for the author to be motivated.
